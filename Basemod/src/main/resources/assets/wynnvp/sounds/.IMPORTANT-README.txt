There are a few files whose name starts with '!'. There are temporary audio files containing robotical voice reading the lines. That's because some quests were changed in the last Wynncraft update and the voice actors didn't submit the new recordings yet. I included these files to not make it look like I forgot to update recordings of lines with those numbers. Also, it will be easier to replace them once the new recordings are submitted.
